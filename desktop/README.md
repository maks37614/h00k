# h00k Desktop — програма для Windows

This is a separate Electron application for the existing https://h00k.top website.
It does not execute exchange scanners on the user's computer or change VPS deployment.

## Current capabilities

- User-selectable MetaScalp, Tiger.Trade, and Vataga, each with an independent persisted profile.
- Several terminals can be enabled at once.
- Full h00k website, selected h00k page panels, or independent floating windows.
- Attach left, right, top, or bottom **outside** the selected terminal's top-level window.
- Gapless seam: zero dock-to-terminal spacing and Win32 DWM visible-frame bounds
  eliminate invisible resize-border gaps; docked h00k panels are frameless and shadowless.
- A persistent ⚙ gear on every attached h00k panel opens a secure native quick menu
  (position, mode, full settings, detach); Ctrl+, also opens the settings for that terminal.
- Faster ~160ms native window position updates while preserving the terminal's order controls.
- Follow terminal movement and resizing, hide docked views when it is minimized.
- Manual OS window selector if a terminal executable has an unexpected name.
- Per-terminal dock size, automatic attach, follow and always-on-top settings.
- A shared h00k web login session. h00k Desktop never asks for exchange API keys.
- An independent full h00k browser window accessible from the settings window.

**Scope:** The selectable panels are real h00k pages: Screener, Formations, Early W/M,
HookChart Terminal, Surveillance and Replay. Individual OI, liquidations, quality-score
and density micro-widgets are not yet isolated as independent components. An
actual native child window embedded *inside* the terminal is not implemented:
these are independent Windows top-level windows arranged by h00k Desktop.

**Vataga:** Vataga docking uses Win32 window detection or manual selection.
Vataga's third-party screener integration is publicly documented but its
command protocol is not. Ticker-linking is intentionally not claimed or attempted
until a verified API specification is available. The existing website MetaScalp
and Tiger local integrations are kept untouched.

## Build on a Windows 10/11 (64-bit) developer machine

~~~powershell
cd desktop
npm install
npm test
npm start
~~~

Build a Windows NSIS installer:

~~~powershell
cd desktop
npm install
npm run dist
~~~

Installer output is in desktop/dist/. GitHub Actions includes a separate
"h00k Desktop Windows" workflow with a manual dispatch trigger and
artifact upload on successful builds. It does not deploy to h00k's VPS.

## Windows and security constraints

The native discovery agent is a single persistent PowerShell process reading
visible top-level window metadata via Win32 EnumWindows and GetWindowRect.
It never injects code, touches the keyboard/mouse, accesses positions, or sends
trades. Window coordinates are converted to Electron logical DPI coordinates.

The h00k remote website is isolated with sandbox, contextIsolation and no
Node integration/preload. Only the local settings page exposes a narrow,
sender-checked IPC bridge.

If the trading terminal is maximized and no space exists beyond the selected
edge, docked views are hidden instead of overlapping the trading controls.
For a maximized terminal use a second monitor, a smaller terminal window,
or manually positioned floating panes.

## Manual acceptance tests still required

Verify on real Windows 10/11, multiple monitors, 100/125/150% DPI,
moving/resizing/minimizing each supported terminal, elevated/UAC terminals,
fullscreen and reconnect behavior, and website login persistence.
MetaScalp and Tiger localhost ticker routing must be validated separately.
Passing Node unit tests is not a substitute for end-to-end Windows tests.

The h00k website query desktopPanel changes presentation only. It does not
grant access to locked sections or expose desktop IPC.

## v0.1.1 quick control and seam verification

The gear is an isolated local WebContentsView with a minimal IPC preload. The
remote h00k.top website cannot invoke toolbar commands. Settings opened from
the gear automatically select the correct provider, including after the settings
window was closed. Switching from docked to floating recreates a decorated
movable window; switching back recreates a frameless dock panel.

Verify that the target edge and h00k panel physically meet at 100%, 125%, and
150% Windows scaling and on a mixed-DPI second monitor. Windows DWM visible
bounds are used when available, while GetWindowRect remains a fallback.
A screenshot alone cannot guarantee every OS decoration/theme is pixel-perfect.

For an already-installed copy, use a new Windows installer from this branch's
successful **h00k Desktop Windows** Actions artifact. Desktop files are not
replaced by updating the Linux VPS.

## v0.1.2 audit fixes

- Saved per-panel floating bounds are validated, retained independently for
  MetaScalp/Tiger/Vataga, and restored when their original monitor is connected.
  An unplugged/off-screen display falls back to a visible work area.
- Explicit changes to floating mode, side or dimensions reposition existing
  windows even if Follow is disabled. New users can choose the initial side
  without needing a running trading terminal.
- Web pages are lazy-loaded **only after** the window has sufficient display
  space and is first displayed. A docked panel hidden for over 30 seconds due
  to a missing/minimized terminal or no free space is destroyed, releasing
  timers/network activity until the terminal returns. The website server itself
  continues handling its ordinary traffic.
- "Автоматично знайти" now clears the manually stored target. A chosen
  executable is found again if its window title changes and there is exactly
  one matching running window.
- The local window picker no longer re-creates its options on every tracker
  tick (especially when PnL/price titles update).

**Authentication limitation:** This version embeds h00k.top in Electron.
Email/password sign-in remains the practical option in the embedded view.
Google OAuth through embedded webviews is not guaranteed (Google restricts
embedded user-agents); this version does not claim to solve external-browser
OAuth callback/session transfer. Do not enter exchange API keys in h00k Desktop.

**Vataga limitation:** Public integration instructions exist (enable application
integration in Settings > General > Other, and select orderbook > Bind to
window > Screener), but the command protocol used by partners is not published.
No unverified API traffic is sent. References:
https://liner.scalpsecta.com/docs
https://vataga.trading/ru/news/releases/obnovlenie-terminala-vataga-terminal-5-13-3

These audit changes need real Windows validation (multi-monitor DPI, actual
trading terminal executables, drag/resize behavior, Google auth experience).

## v0.1.3: branded Windows installer

- The Windows executable, taskbar and its desktop shortcut use a **multi-resolution
  h00k robot-eyes icon** (16 through 256 px) instead of the Electron placeholder.
  The graphic is generated from the original existing `public/h00k-robot-logo.svg`
  with no external image files.
- The assisted NSIS install/uninstall wizard includes dark-navy h00k-themed
  sidebar illustrations and a cyan-on-dark header (true 24-bit BMP graphics);
  standard Windows wizard controls retain the native Windows theme.
- The setup wizard now offers a **real "Створити ярлик h00k на робочому столі"
  checkbox**. It defaults to checked; uncheck it to omit the shortcut. The
  Start menu shortcut remains available. During re-installation the explicit
  unchecked choice also clears an old desktop link.
- `desktop/build/installer.nsh` extends the existing electron-builder NSIS
  script rather than replacing the install/uninstall implementation.
- Branding assets are generated locally during `npm test` and `npm run dist`
  via `npm run brand-assets`. They are intentionally ignored by Git because
  the robot source SVG remains the single source of truth.
- New tests verify the robot ICO structure, its multi-resolution PNG frames,
  24-bit bitmap dimensions, and the optional shortcut script.

Run on Windows:
```powershell
cd desktop
npm install
npm test
npm run dist
```
Download the installer from the **h00k Desktop Windows** GitHub Actions
artifact. No Linux VPS deployment is needed. If you previously pinned the
old Electron icon on the Windows taskbar, unpin it and pin the newly installed
h00k Desktop again to refresh the taskbar cache.

## v0.1.4 — installer upgrade / shortcut QA

- The **Create h00k desktop shortcut** checkbox remains optional, and now its
  explicit choice is saved in the installer's registry key. Silent upgrades do
  not unexpectedly recreate a shortcut that the user previously declined.
- Unchecking deletes both old and new desktop links; rechecking restores the
  current link with the correct AppUserModelID, preserving the h00k robot icon
  even if electron-builder's upgrade logic kept old shortcuts.
- IT administrators may control shortcuts in a silent installation:
  `"h00k Desktop Setup 0.1.4.exe" /S /NO_DESKTOP_SHORTCUT` or
  `"h00k Desktop Setup 0.1.4.exe" /S /DESKTOP_SHORTCUT`.
  Without either switch, the user's last explicit choice is preserved.
  Start Menu shortcuts are unaffected.
- GitHub Actions now **runs the generated installer on Windows**, tests
  unchecked / silent-upgrade / checked cases and checks that the resulting
  desktop link points to an installed application carrying a Windows icon.
  It also publishes a companion `SHA256SUMS.txt` in the same artifact ZIP.

### Verify the downloaded setup file

After extracting the GitHub Actions artifact in PowerShell:

```powershell
Get-FileHash '.\h00k Desktop Setup 0.1.4.exe' -Algorithm SHA256
Get-Content .\SHA256SUMS.txt
```

The two SHA-256 values should match. The current development installer is
**not Authenticode code-signed**; Windows SmartScreen may warn for this reason.
Do not bypass warnings from unknown sources. Publisher signing should be
configured only after a suitable certificate is available. The changes above
do not involve production VPS deployment.

## v0.1.5 — exact h00k robot icon in Windows setup

- The Windows **installer .exe** now uses a dedicated
  `desktop/build/h00k-installer.ico` resource generated from the original
  `public/h00k-robot-logo.svg` eyes and robot bezel only. No letter h/k,
  decorative background tile, extra frame, or stripe is added.
- The **app EXE / desktop and Start menu shortcuts** use the same clean
  transparent robot artwork (`desktop/build/h00k.ico`) in 16, 24, 32, 48,
  64, 128 and 256 pixel sizes. This keeps Windows Explorer, taskbar and installer
  branding consistent.
- Both icons are generated directly from the repository's vector source;
  static PNG preview `h00k-robot-preview.png` accompanies the GitHub Actions
  installer artifact ZIP for visual verification.
- CI now extracts the **actual embedded icon from the NSIS setup .exe** and
  compares its visible pixels against the generated h00k source icon. This
  detects cases where the package config points to the right .ico but the setup
  executable ends up with a default NSIS/Electron icon.
- Desktop tests validate transparency, cyan eyes, dark bezel, .ico frame sizes
  and the generated preview. The installer upgrade/shortcut tests remain intact.

Windows may cache old icons after upgrading. If Windows Explorer or an existing
pinned taskbar shortcut still shows an old image, unpin the old shortcut, remove
the existing desktop shortcut if needed, and pin the new h00k Desktop executable
after installing v0.1.5. That is a Windows icon cache behavior, not a reason
to overwrite or restart the h00k VPS.

## v0.1.7 — four-language Windows installer and translated first-run guide

The real NSIS setup (not just the design mockup) now offers a first-page
language selector: **English (default), Polski, Русский, Українська**.
English is the initial choice even on non-English Windows installations.
Choosing a language changes the native NSIS wizard labels, h00k welcome,
desktop-shortcut prompt, and the post-install onboarding pages. The installer
remembers the explicit selection for later upgrades; the uninstaller uses
that language too.

After the application files install, three translated onboarding pages explain:

1. Starting h00k Desktop and selecting a MetaScalp, Tiger.Trade or Vataga window.
2. Full-site / selected page / floating window modes, placement on all sides,
   automatic follow, and the gear shortcut for quick settings.
3. Existing MetaScalp/Tiger symbol linking, current limits of the Vataga API,
   and safe read-only exchange API keys (when used in supported h00k features).

**Security:** h00k Desktop does **not** need API keys; never give trading
or withdrawal permissions to a read-only connection. Docking Vataga windows
is supported, but automatic ticker linking over a Vataga API has not been
implemented because the external protocol has not been confirmed.

The translations are maintained centrally in
`desktop/i18n/installer.json`. Run `npm run installer-locales` to regenerate
`desktop/build/installer-locales.nsh`; `npm test` and `npm run dist` regenerate
it automatically. Silent installations support an explicit
`/H00K_LANG=en`, `/H00K_LANG=pl`, `/H00K_LANG=ru`, or `/H00K_LANG=uk`.
Without a previous choice, silent installs also default to English.
Windows CI smoke-tests English default, Polish, Russian and Ukrainian choices
and persisted registry language, while preserving the shortcut preference.

## Animated compact Windows setup (v0.1.9)

The preferred download is **h00k-animated-windows-setup**, not the fallback
NSIS installer. The graphical launcher is a separate Windows executable,
approximately **720 × 320 logical pixels** (user-requested height 320px),
with a charcoal-blue h00k surface, English initially selected and Polish,
Russian and Ukrainian also available. It uses the original blinking robot
eyes from `public/h00k-robot-logo.svg`, adds two animated legs and makes
pupils follow the pointer **inside the installer only**.

The welcome screen shows h00k's wordmark without the walking robot. The
robot emerges on the **real installation-folder picker**. During installation,
its position follows the fraction of expected application bytes that have
actually been observed written to the destination. The progress meter is
therefore a file-writing estimate, **not an artificial timer or a precise
measure of every NSIS setup step**. It remains capped at 96% until the silent
NSIS worker exits successfully and the desktop executable is found. When no
new bytes are observed, the robot stops walking but can blink.

The animated UI **does not replace NSIS package management**. It bundles
the ordinary h00k Desktop NSIS installer as a checked internal worker,
runs it with `/S`, the selected `/H00K_LANG` and shortcut choice, and
passes the chosen folder via the final unquoted `/D=` argument. The NSIS
worker continues to own Windows uninstall registration, Start menu and
desktop shortcut creation, upgrade behavior and installation of the actual
h00k application. The launcher verifies the worker's SHA-256 before execution.

After installation, it opens a **separate h00k Quick Start window** with
instructions in the selected language for window docking, panel modes,
MetaScalp/Tiger symbol linking, Vataga's currently unconfirmed ticker API,
and read-only exchange API best practices. No private API keys are required
by h00k Desktop. The installer is currently unsigned.

### Build on a Windows x64 development environment

```powershell
cd desktop
npm install
npm test
npm run dist
node installer/prepare.cjs
npm test --prefix installer
# GitHub Actions stages the launcher outside the parent npm project
# and runs installer/build-isolated.ps1 on Windows.
```

GitHub Actions performs these steps, verifies the original NSIS installer
via an actual unattended installation, checks that the portable launcher
contains a non-corrupted worker and publishes an SHA-256 checksum. The
fallback **h00k-desktop-windows** artifact remains available until the
animated launcher passes real on-device GUI testing.

If a custom installation folder is protected by Windows permissions, use
a writable per-user location (recommended under LocalAppData/Programs).
This launcher does not silently elevate privileges or intercept credentials.

**Manual verification remaining:** actual pointer/eye motion and walking
frame pacing on Windows 10 and 11 with high-DPI screens; unplugged/secondary
monitors, reopening Quick Start and visual line wrapping in all languages.

**Build isolation:** the animated setup is staged in RUNNER_TEMP before
packaging because electron-builder otherwise includes a nested copy of the
parent h00k project and a duplicate NSIS executable. CI rejects duplicate
workers and a launcher app.asar larger than 30MB. Use the Windows CI workflow
for this reproducible packaging path; do not run electron-builder from the
nested installer folder in an unisolated checkout.

## Unreleased: unified dark desktop surfaces and first-run experience

- A first installation opens the local h00k settings with a cyan-accented three-step
  welcome panel. Docking remains paused until the user saves/attaches settings.
- Legacy smartdock.json profiles are treated as already configured; their existing
  automatic attachment is preserved without requiring a new onboarding step.
- A full standalone h00k Desktop window now has the same isolated top-right gear
  as attached panels. Its native menu opens general or terminal-specific settings.
- The settings window uses the existing robot logo, a dark graphite/cyan palette,
  accessible keyboard focus, and responsive controls. Assets are packaged locally.
- No desktop changes in this feature branch update the website or VPS, and the
  final Windows installer has not been built or merged.

Manual checks remaining: first launch on Windows, caption/theme under light-mode
Windows, toolbar overlay against actual h00k pages, focus and DPI at 100–150%,
and re-launch from a pre-existing smartdock.json file.

## Unreleased: branded main application frame

The main h00k window now uses a **local 54 px h00k title bar** with the original
robot logo and the dark/cyan h00k palette. Native minimize/maximize/close controls
are implemented by a sender-checked, minimal local IPC bridge, and the right-side
gear opens docking and per-terminal quick settings. Remote h00k.top content stays in
an isolated sandboxed WebContentsView **below** the title bar; its web session is
shared with other panels using the existing `persist:h00k` partition. No credentials
or website APIs are exposed to the title bar.

A fresh install opens docking setup first, then after initial Save/Attach launches
the branded main window. Subsequent application launches open the main window
directly; Ctrl+, or the gear provides access to setup. Existing persisted profiles
are treated as configured and retained.

Important: visually test Win10/11 frameless-window resizing, keyboard shortcut,
site navigation/authentication, multi-DPI/monitors, docking modes and sleep/resume
before publishing a final installer.

## Unreleased: branded floating windows

Floating h00k panels now reuse the same local 54 px titlebar, robot emblem,
window controls and top-right docking gear as the main app. A separate sandboxed
website view loads below the titlebar only when layout permits. Docked (seamless)
panels keep their minimal overlay gear and do not acquire the extra 54 px strip;
this maintains their existing gapless terminal alignment.

## Automatic attachment audit (Windows-only)

- The single persistent Win32 agent discovers visible application windows and
  h00k keeps one independent automatic attachment profile **per provider**:
  MetaScalp, Tiger.Trade and Vataga. Enabling both 'Enable terminal' and
  'Attach automatically' is necessary. Manual 'Attach now' lasts only for that run
  when automatic attachment is disabled.
- A pinned/manual window cannot silently switch to a different instance if an
  HWND is recycled or multiple same-executable windows become ambiguous.
  In that situation, select the specific window again.
- Docked panels never cover detected windows belonging to other recognized
  trading terminals or manually selected executable targets. If the chosen
  side is occupied, h00k hides that panel and reports the conflict; floating
  panels remain independently movable and may intentionally overlap.
- A single profile selects ONE window per provider. Multiple windows of the
  same terminal can be chosen manually; it does not automatically create a
  separate dock for every instance.
- **OS scope:** Native window discovery/docking is Windows-only. macOS and
  Linux have no agent or native auto-attachment implementation in this release;
  standalone HTML content may run in a development Electron environment but
  no non-Windows installer has been built.
- CI validates logic using simulated windows plus a read-only Win32 agent
  smoke test. Physical tests with all three real terminals (Windows 10/11,
  admin/UAC, multi-monitor, DPI and minimized windows) are still needed.
